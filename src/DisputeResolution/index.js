After they agree on a price, terms and conditions, Miguel gets to work. A couple of weeks later, he delivers the product. But Giselle is not satisfied. She argues that the quality of Miguelâ€™s work is considerably lower than expected. Miguel replies that he did exactly what was in the agreement.",
